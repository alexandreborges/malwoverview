## Current Version: 6.0.0

     Important note:  Malwoverview does NOT submit samples to any endpoint by default, 
     so it respects possible Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). There're specific options
     that explicitly submit samples, but these options are explained in the help.


## ABOUT

Malwoverview.py is a first response tool for threat hunting, which performs an initial and quick 
triage of malware samples, URLs, IP addresses, domains, malware families, IOCs and hashes. Additionally,
Malwoverview is able to get dynamic and static behavior reports, submit and download samples
from several endpoints. In few words, it works as a client to main existing sandboxes. 

This tool aims to : 

1. Determine similar executable malware samples (PE/PE+) according to the import table (imphash) and group 
   them by different colors (pay attention to the second column from output). Thus, colors matter!
2. Show hash information on Virus Total, Hybrid Analysis, Malshare, Polyswarm, URLhaus, Alien Vault, 
   Malpedia and ThreatCrowd engines. 
3. Determining whether the malware samples contain overlay and, if you want, extract it. 
4. Check suspect files on Virus Total, Hybrid Analysis and Polyswarm.
5. Check URLs on Virus Total, Malshare, Polyswarm, URLhaus engines and Alien Vault. 
6. Download malware samples from Hybrid Analysis, Malshare, URLHaus, Polyswarm and Malpedia engines.
7. Submit malware samples to VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis and Polyswarm.
8. List last suspected URLs from URLHaus.
9. List last payloads from URLHaus. 
10. Search for specific payloads on the Malshare.
11. Search for similar payloads (PE32/PE32+) on Polyswarm engine.
12. Classify all files in a directory searching information on Virus Total and Hybrid Analysis. 
13. Make reports about a suspect domain using different engines such as VirusTotal, Malpedia and 
    ThreatCrowd. 
14. Check APK packages directly from Android devices against Hybrid Analysis and Virus Total. 
15. Submit APK packages directly from Android devices to Hybrid Analysis and Virus Total. 
16. Show URLs related to an user provided tag from URLHaus.
17. Show payloads related to a tag (signature) from URLHaus.
18. Show information about an IP address from Virus Total, Alien Vault, Malpedia and ThreatCrowd.
19. Show IP address, domain and URL information from Polyswarm. 
21. Perform meta-search on Polyswarm Network using several criteria: imphash, IPv4, domain, URL and
    malware family. 
22. Gather threat hunting information from AlienVault using different criteria. 
23. Gather threat hunting information from Malpedia using different criteria. 
24. Gather threat hunting information from Malware Bazaar using different criteria. 
25. Gather IOC information from ThreatFox using different criteria. 
26. Gather threat hunting information from Triage using different criteria. 
27. Get evaluation to hashes from a given file against Virus Total. 
28. Submit large files (>= 32 MB) to Virus Total. 
29. Malwoverview uses Virus Total API v.3, so there isn't longer any option using v.2.
30. Retrieve different information from InQuest Labs and download samples from there.

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PROJECT

Since version 6.0.0, there is a new branch named "dev". All contributions and proposals 
must be done into this "dev" branch.

Professionals who want to contribute must open an issue explaining your proposed improvement 
and how it would make the project better. Once it has been accepted, so she/he is 
authorized to submit the PR, which will be tested. 

Once all changes are tested, this new version of Malwoverview is replicated to the master 
branch and a new Python package is generated.

## INSTALLATION

This tool has been tested on REMnux, Ubuntu, Kali Linux, macOS and Windows. Malwoverview 
can be installed by executing the following command:

      * pip3.11 install git+https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview (preferred method) 
      
      or...
      
      * python -m pip install -U malwoverview
      
If you want to install the Malwoverview on macOS, you have to execute the following commands:

      * /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
      * brew install libmagic
      * pip3 install urllib3==1.26.6
      * pip3 install -U malwoverview
      * Add Python binary directory to the PATH variable by editing .bash_profile file in your home 
        directory. Example:

          export PATH=$PATH:/Users/alexandreborges/Library/Python/3.9/bin

      * Execute: . ./.bash_profile

If you are installing Malwoverview on Windows, make sure that the following conditions are true  
AFTER having installed Malwoverview:

      * python-magic is NOT installed. (pip show python-magic)
      * python-magic-bin IS installed. (pip show python-magic-bin)
      
To use Malwoverview you should insert VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, URLHaus, Malshare, Polyswarm,
Alien Vault, Malpedia  and Triage into the .malwapi.conf configuration file 
(the default one at the home directory (/home/[username] or /root) -- if the file doesn't exist,
so you should create it) or you could create a custom configuration file and indicate it by 
using the -c option.

Nonetheless, starting on version 4.4.2, it isn't longer necessary to insert all APIs into 
.malwapi.conf file before using Malwoverview. Therefore, users can only insert few APIs 
and use the respective options to these APIs.

* A special note about the Alien Vault: it is necessary to subscribe to pulses on Alien Vault 
website before using -n 1 option.

The .malwapi.conf configuration file (from the the home directory -- /home/[username] or /root) 
has the following format:

      [VIRUSTOTAL]
      VTAPI = 

      [HYBRID-ANALYSIS]
      HAAPI = 

      [MALSHARE]
      MALSHAREAPI = 

      [HAUSSUBMIT]
      HAUSSUBMITAPI =

      [POLYSWARM]
      POLYAPI = 

      [ALIENVAULT]
      ALIENAPI = 

      [MALPEDIA]
      MALPEDIAAPI =

      [TRIAGE]
      TRIAGEAPI =

      [INQUEST]
      INQUESTAPI =


The APIs can be requested on the respective service websites:

01. Virus Total (community and paid API): https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us
02. Hybrid Analysis: https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/signup
03. Malshare: https://malshare.com/doc.php
04. URLHaus: https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/api/#account 
05. Polyswarm: https://docs.polyswarm.io/consumers
06. Alien Vault: https://otx.alienvault.com/api
07. Malpedia: It doesn't offer open registration, but you can request an user account 
    directly through Twitter (DM) or feedback e-email. The Malpedia Twitter 
    handle is @malpedia.
08. Malware Bazaar: It isn't necessary an API.
09. ThreatFox: It isn't necessary an API.
10. InQuest: https://labs.inquest.net/.
11. Triage: https://tria.ge/signup.
 
----------------------------------------------------
A special note about API requests to the MALPEDIA:
----------------------------------------------------

The service and acceptance is based on the community vetting. Thus, it's recommended 
you send a request for an API from your business e-mail address and NOT 
public/free one (Gmail, Outlook and so on). Additionally, it'd be great whether 
you provided further information about you (LinkedIn account, Twitter and so on) 
because it would make simpler to proof your identity, professional profile and 
legitimacy, so making quicker the approval of your request.  

-----------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------
Additional explanation about Triage:
----------------------------------------------------

Every Triage operation is based on the Triage ID of each artifact, so you need to
use the "-x 1 -X \<attribute\>:\<value\>" to search for the correct ID of the artifact,
so use this ID information with the remaining Triage options (-x [2-7]) for getting 
further threat hunting information from Triage endpoint.

-----------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------
Note about background color of the terminal:
----------------------------------------------------

Malwoverview has been written to produce outputs to 
dark background terminal. However, there's the -o 0 
option, which changes and adapts output's colors to 
light background.

-----------------------------------------------------

On Linux and MacOS systems, create the .malwapi.conf file within
/home/\[username\] directory (Linux home user directory -- /home/[username] or /root).

To check the installation, execute:

       malwoverview --help
       
Further information is available on: 

       (PYPI.org repository) https://pypi.org/project/malwoverview/
       (Github) https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview

If you want to perform the manual installation (it is not usually necessary), so few steps 
should be executed:

## MANUAL INSTALLATION (REMnux and Ubuntu)

1. Python version 3.8 or later (Only Python 3.x !!! It does NOT work using Python 2.7) 

       $ apt-get install python3.11  (for example)

2. Python-magic.  

      To install python-magic package you can execute the following command:

       $ pip3.11 install python-magic

      Or you can compile it from the github repository:

       $ git clone https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic
       $ cd python-magic/
       $ python3.11 setup.py build
       $ python3.11 setup.py install

      As there are serious issues related to existing two versions of python-magic package, the  
      recommendation is to install it from github (second procedure above) and copy the magic.py 
      file to the SAME directory of malwoverview tool. 
      
3. Install all needed Python packages: 

       $ pip3.11 install -r requirements.txt

       OR

       $ pip3.11 install -U pefile
       $ pip3.11 install -U colorama
       $ pip3.11 install -U simplejson
       $ pip3.11 install -U python-magic
       $ pip3.11 install -U requests
       $ pip3.11 install -U validators
       $ pip3.11 install -U geocoder
       $ pip3.11 install -U polyswarm-api
       $ pip3.11 install -U pathlib
       $ pip3.11 install -U configparser

4. To check an Android mobile you need to install the "adb" tool:

       $ sudo apt get install adb

   PS: before trying Android's options, check:

       * If the adb tool is listed in the PATH environment variable.
       * If the system has authorized access to the device by using "adb devices -l"
